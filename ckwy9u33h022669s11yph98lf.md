## Advent of Code 2021: Day 8

This blog post is eighth in the Advent of Code 2021 series and shows a JavaScript-based solution to the problem described in [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8). The challenge was about decoding four-digit numbers represented using a seven-segment display. The difficulty in solving this problem increased compared to the previous days and I struggled a bit to find the solution in part two. However, this was my favourite challenge so far.

All solutions are in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mancristiana/advent-of-code-2021).

## Understanding the Problem
The problem is about decoding digits represented using a seven-segment display. Each segment has a name from `a` to `g`. By default, if we name the segments in order, the digits from `0` to `9` are represented by the segments `abcefg`, `cf`, `acdeg`, `acdfg`, `bcdf`, `abdfg`, `abdefg`, `acf`, `abcdefg` and `abcdfg` .

The problem is we don't know which letter corresponds to which segment. We must deduct it from a set of ten unique segment patterns representing digits from 0 to 9 given in random order. For example, given the pattern 
```
acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab
```

we must find a way to deduce the name of each segment. The segment mapping from the example is illustrated below.

The pattern from the example represents the following digits:
```
acedgfb: 8 cdfbe: 5 gcdfa: 2 fbcad: 3 dab: 7 cefabd: 9 cdfgeb: 6 eafb: 4 cagedb: 0 ab: 1
```

## Understanding the Input
We are given multiple lines, each containing ten unique signal patterns, a delimiter and four output values. For example, 
```
acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab | cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
```

## Solving Part One
The goal is to count the number of four-digit output values representing either `1`, `4`, `7` and `8`. The problem description hints that these digits have a unique number of segments. Indeed only `1` has two segments,  only `4` has four segments, only `7` has three segments and only `8` has seven segments.

To solve part one we must:
- read the output values
- check if any output value has a unique length
- sum all output values with unique length

### Read the output values
Since we only need the output value for part one, we can extract them from each line using the delimiter `|`.
```js
const lines = data.split('\n')
const outputValues = lines.map((line) => line.split(' | ')[1])
```
Then to extract each digit into an array we can use the space as separator.
```js
const digits = outputValue.split(" ")
```

### Check if any output value has a unique length
Since `1`, `4`, `7`, `8` are represented using `2`, `4`, `3`, `7` segments respectively, we can check whether the length of the digit is one of those numbers. The `includes` function is useful for performing this check.
```js
[2, 4, 3, 7].includes(digit.length)
```

### Count all output values with unique length
We can use the `reduce` function to count output values respecting the condition previously defined. 
```js
digits.reduce((digitCount, digit) => {
  if ([2, 4, 3, 7].includes(digit.length)) {
    return digitCount + 1
  }
  return digitCount
}, 0)
```
Then, we can use the `reduce` function again to sum digits from all lines.
```js
return outputValues.reduce((digitCount, outputValue) => {
  const digits = outputValue.split(" ")
  
  return digitCount + digits.reduce((count, digit) => {
    if([2, 4, 3, 7].includes(digit.length)) {
      return count + 1
    }
    return count
  },0)
}, 0)
```

The final solution for part one is in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mancristiana/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/src/day-08-seven-segment-search/one.js).

## Solving Part Two
The second part of the problem was the tricky one. 
The goal of the second part was to decode all output values, from a four-digit number and sum all four-digit numbers.

I used a top-down approach where I wrote higher-level functions first and, thus defined the overall structure of the program, then defined the lower-level functions and went into detail. Here is how I broke down the problem:
- sum all output numbers
- decode output number
  - find segment mapping
  - reveal corresponding digits using segment map
  - find output value based on revealed digits

The trickiest part was finding the segment mapping, in other words, identifying the name of each segment. The strategy was:
- calculating segment occurrences in all ten unique patterns
- identifying the segments with unique occurrences
- identifying digits with unique segment length
- use a process of elimination 


### Sum all output numbers
We can outline the solution as follows. We define the `getOutput` function afterwards. 
```js
const solve = (data) => {
  const lines = data.split('\n')
  return lines.reduce((sum, line) => sum + getOutput(line), 0)
}
```
### Decode output number
We can further outline the solution:
```js
const getOutput = (line) => {
  const [segmentPatternsString, outputValuesString] = line.split(' | ')
  const segmentMap = findSegmentNamesMap(segmentPatternsString)
  const correspondingSevenSegmentDisplay = getSevenSegmentDisplay(segmentMap)

  return getOutputDigits(outputValuesString, correspondingSevenSegmentDisplay)
}
```

Let's look at an example line. Given the line 
```
acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab | cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
```
the `segmentPatternsString` is 
```
acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab
```
 and `outputValuesString` is 
```
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
```

The `findSegmentNamesMap` function returns the following mapping:
```js
{
  a: 'd',
  b: 'e',
  c: 'a',
  d: 'f',
  e: 'g',
  f: 'b',
  g: 'c',
}
```

The `getSevenSegmentDisplay` function maps each digit based on the default seven segment display.
So, the default seven-segment display
```js
[ 'abcefg', 'cf', 'acdeg', 'acdfg', 'bcdf', 'abdfg', 'abdefg', 'acf', 'abcdefg', 'abcdfg']
```
becomes the following based on the segment names map
```js
['abcdeg', 'ab', 'acdfg', 'abcdf', 'abef', 'bcdef', 'bcdefg', 'abd', 'abcdefg', 'abcdef']
```
Notice the letters are sorted alphabetically. This makes identifying the output digits easier.
The `getOutputDigits` maps the `outputValuesString` to `5353`.

### Find segment mapping

We can start by initializing the segment name map:
```js
const findSegmentNamesMap = (segmentPatternsString) => {
  const segmentMap = { a: '', b: '', c: '', d: '', e: '', f: '', g: '' }

  return segmentMap
}
```

#### Identifying the segments with unique occurrences
Using the default segment names we have the digits from `0` to `9` represented as:
```js
const sevenSegmentDisplay = [ 'abcefg', 'cf', 'acdeg', 'acdfg', 'bcdf', 'abdfg', 'abdefg', 'acf', 'abcdefg', 'abcdfg']
```
and each letter occurs as follows
```js
const abcdefgOccurence = { a: 8, b: 6, c: 8, d: 7, e: 4, f: 9, g: 7 } 
```
Thus, the `b`, `e` and `f` segments occur a unique number of times. We can use this information to determine the segment name mapping for these values.

```js
const findSegmentNamesMap = (segmentPatternsString) => {
  const segmentMap = { a: '', b: '', c: '', d: '', e: '', f: '', g: '' }

  const letterOccurence = calculateLetterOccurence(segmentPatternsString)
  segmentMap.b = findLetter(letterOccurence, abcdefgOccurence.b)
  segmentMap.e = findLetter(letterOccurence, abcdefgOccurence.e)
  segmentMap.f = findLetter(letterOccurence, abcdefgOccurence.f)

  return segmentMap
}
```

#### Identifying segments based on digits with unique segment length
Part one hinted at using the length of digits. We can deduce `a`, `c` and `d`.

To find the segment corresponding to `a`, we can identify numbers `1` and `7` in the `segmentPatternsString`. We are looking for the letter not present in `1`. For example, given `ab` and `abd` we can determine that `d` is the name corresponding to segment `a`.
```js
const findA = (segmentPatternsString) => {
  const one = findDigitBySignalsLength(segmentPatternsString, 2)
  const seven = findDigitBySignalsLength(segmentPatternsString, 3)

  let a = seven
  one.split('').forEach((letter) => {
    a = a.replace(letter, '')
  })
  return a
}
```

To find the segment corresponding to `c`, we can identify the number `1` in the `segmentPatternsString` and eliminate the previously found segment corresponding to `f`.  For example, given `ab` and the previously found `b` corresponding to `f`, we can deduce that `a` is the name corresponding to `c`.

```js
const findC = (segmentPatternsString, letterF) => {
  const one = segmentPatternsString
    .split(' ')
    .find((digit) => digit.length === 2)
  return one.replace(letterF, '')
}
```

To find the segment corresponding to `d`, we can identify the number`4` in the `segmentPatternsString` and eliminate the previously found segment corresponding to `b`, `c` and `f`.  For example, given `eafb`, and the previously found `e` corresponding to `b`, `a` corresponding to `c` and `b` corresponding to `f`, we can deduce that `f` is the name corresponding to `d`.

```js
const findD = (segmentPatternsString, signalMap) => {
  const four = findDigitBySignalsLength(segmentPatternsString, 4)
  return four
    .replace(signalMap.b, '')
    .replace(signalMap.c, '')
    .replace(signalMap.f, '')
}
```

#### Use a process of elimination 
After mapping `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` and `f`, we can determine the segment corresponding to `g` by process of elimination.
```
const findG = (signalMap) => {
  let allLetters = 'abcdefg'
  Object.keys(signalMap).forEach(
    (key) => (allLetters = allLetters.replace(signalMap[key], ''))
  )
  return allLetters
}
```

The final solution for part two is in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mancristiana/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/src/day-08-seven-segment-search/two.js).

## Conclusion
Day 8 was really challenging and entailed decoding numbers by identifying unique occurrences, segment lengths and by process of elimination.
